## About XeroPHP ##
**XeroPHP** is an unofficial, general-purpose PHP implementation of the Xero API, allowing PHP apps to easily connect to [Xero Accounting](http://www.xero.com) without handling OAuth/HTTP/XML or Xero's specific data types directly. It provides native implementation of the entire Xero RESTful API object model, including response parsing to data structures, and a full implementation of all OAuth/HTTP methods used by Xero. All three Private, Public and Partner application types are supported.

XeroPHP currently implements Version 2.0 of the Xero API. XeroPHP's object model is derived from Xero's published XSD schemas, which are distributed by Xero under the MIT License.

## Version History ##
The project is currently in an early alpha stage. XeroPHP v0.1a has an expected "bleeding edge" release date of August 1st, 2011. (_This initial alpha version should be used in production applications at developers' own risk; they may do better to wait until the beta stage, unless they are really desperate._)

  * **Planned 2011-08-01**: XeroPHP v0.1a (alpha prerelease)

## Support ##
At the moment, there is no online community available for informal support in using XeroPHP for developing Xero-compatible applications. Any questions, queries, bugs or issues for contributors and non-commercial developers should be addressed to Nicholas Turnbull <nicholas dot turnbull at gmail.com>, the project author.

Support for commercial development, consultancy and paid extensions are also available from the author, albeit on a chargeable basis.
